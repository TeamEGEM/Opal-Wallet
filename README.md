# Opal-Wallet
Opal Wallet for EtherGem

The current release is Opal-Alpha-0.0.1

and it is available at:
Windows:
./releases/Opal-Alpha-0.0.1/Opal-Alpha-0.0.1-win32-x64.rar
Mac:
./releases/Opal-Alpha-0.0.1/[tba]
Linux:
./releases/Opal-Alpha-0.0.1/[tba]


This is a bare bones basic feature release to get community feedback. We will follow
with iterative beta releases based on that feedback until the wallet shapes itself
to the needs of the EGEM community.

Please comment, suggest, critique, blast it, say it sucks, appreciate it, compliment
it, hate on it, use it and tell us what you want.

You can email me at osoese@egem.io or just catch us core devs on the discord

We have an EGEM founders reward already in place for development funding, so if you
feel the need to donate, send it to the rain bot:

EGEM: 0x9b41c5d87deb2fedc2ef419411cf82e6827cbcbd

and register your address on our discord channel because it will rain on the
community.
